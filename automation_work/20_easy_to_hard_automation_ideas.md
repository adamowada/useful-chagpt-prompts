    creds = None
    token_file = 'token.pickle'

    if os.path.exists(token_file):
        with open(token_file, 'rb') as token:
            creds = pickle.load(token)

    if not creds or not creds.valid:
        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
        else:
            flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file('credentials.json', ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'])
            creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)

        with open(token_file, 'wb') as token:
            pickle.dump(creds, token)

    try:
        service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)
        return service
    except HttpError as error:
        print(f"An error occurred: {error}")
        return None
```

4. Define a function to upload a file to Google Drive:

def upload_file_to_drive(drive_service, file_path, folder_id=None):
    file_metadata = {
        'name': os.path.basename(file_path),
    }
    
    if folder_id:
        file_metadata['parents'] = [folder_id]

    media = MediaFileUpload(file_path, resumable=True)

    try:
        file = drive_service.files().create(body=file_metadata, media_body=media, fields='id').execute()
        print(f"File ID: {file.get('id')}")
    except HttpError as error:
        print(f"An error occurred: {error}")
        file = None

    return file
```

5. Authenticate and create the Google Drive API client:

```python
drive_service = authenticate_and_create_drive_service()
```

6. Upload a file to Google Drive:

```python
file_path = 'path/to/your/file.txt'
uploaded_file = upload_file_to_drive(drive_service, file_path)
```

This is a basic tutorial for creating an automatic data backup script using the Google Drive API. You can further customize this script by adding features like:

- Backing up multiple files or entire directories.

- Specifying a specific Google Drive folder for backups.
